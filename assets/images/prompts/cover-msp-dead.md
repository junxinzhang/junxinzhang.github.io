# Cover Image Prompt

## Title
传统MSP已死

## Visual Concept
A minimalist composition depicting the transition from traditional IT operations to AI Agent paradigm.

## Core Elements
- **Left side (fading)**: Simplified silhouette of traditional server rack or gear icon, rendered in muted gray tones, slightly transparent/fading
- **Center**: A clean transition line or gradient bridge
- **Right side (emerging)**: Stylized AI brain-circuit hybrid icon or neural network pattern, glowing softly in warm coral tones
- **Overall**: Generous whitespace (50%+), clean horizontal composition

## Visual Metaphor
The passing of an era - old infrastructure quietly receding while intelligent systems emerge. NOT dramatic destruction, but elegant succession.

## Color Palette (Warm Morandi)
- Primary: Soft coral (#E8756D)
- Secondary: Mint green (#7ECFC0)
- Accent: Cream/warm white (#FFF8F0)
- Muted background: Warm beige (#F5EDE6)
- Fading elements: Soft gray (#B8B5B0)

## Composition
- Horizontal layout optimized for 2.35:1 cinematic ratio
- Main visual anchor slightly left of center
- Title positioned right side or bottom, clean sans-serif typography
- No realistic human figures - icons and abstract shapes only
- Minimalist line art style with flat fills

## Style Notes
- Clean vector aesthetic, uniform stroke weights
- Soft shadows if any, minimal gradients
- Professional but approachable
- Avoid cluttered or busy elements
- Icon vocabulary: server/gear (old) → brain/network (new)

## Mood
Balanced - neither melancholic about the past nor overly celebratory. Professional acknowledgment of inevitable change.
